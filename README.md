I'm doing completely random stuff on this account, so honestly this next line is just gonna be what I'm working on right now.

### Current Project:

Me and [my dad](https://github.com/Myoldmopar) are about to start working on a charity project. It is going to be protecting the food at our town's food pantry by using Raspberry Pi Pico W's to track the current temperature of the fridges and freezers.

### About Me

I really like playing video games. Here's some that I really highlight and would recommend to anyone getting into it.

<details>
  <summary>Games</summary>
  <ul>
    <li>Chess <a href="https://chess.com/members/gsl4295">(My chess.com account.)</a></li>
    <li>Hogwarts Legacy (I just got it like a week ago, it's SO GOOD)</li>
    <li>Minecraft (I mean, who doesn't enjoy playing it?)</li>
    <li>Rocket League (I'm like Platinum 3 at the time of writing)</li>
  </ul>
</details>

Computers are kind of a big deal for me so here's just some stuff that I have done.
  
<details>
  <summary>Computer Experience</summary>
  <ul>
    <dt>Built my own PC from scratch. My specs are listed as follows:</dt>
    <ul>
      <li>CPU = Intel Core i5-12600K</li>
      <li>RAM = 32GB of 3200Mhz (16GB x 2)</li>
      <li>MB = ROG Strix B660-A</li>
      <li>GPU = ASRock Radeon RX6700XT Challenger Series</li>
      <li>PSU = EVGA 850W 80+ Certified Gold Fully Modular</li>
      <li>Case = Corsair 220T RGB</li>
    </ul>
    <dt>Before I made my computer, I downloaded Ubuntu 22.04 LTS to my computer for a short-term solution until I wanted to get Windows 11. It was actually tougher than I thought it would be to switch back to Windows, but I did in the end. </dt>
    </dl>

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm doing completely random stuff on this account, so honestly this next line is just gonna be what I'm working on right now.

### Current Project:

Me and <a href="github.com/Myoldmopar">my dad</a> are about to start working on a charity project. It is going to be protecting the food at our town's food pantry by using Raspberry Pi Pico W's to track the current temperature of the fridges and freezers.

Click <a href="github.com/gibslee/PantryTemp">here</a> to learn more about our project.
